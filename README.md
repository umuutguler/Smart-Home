# Smart-Home

This project is a smart home system. It has been developed using Arduino and the circuit design is done using Proteus.

The circuit components used in the project are:
Arduino Mega 2560
Buzzer
Flame Sensor
Keypad
Lamp
Green LED
Red LED
LCD Display
Temperature Sensor
PIR Sensor

## Operation

When the flame sensor is activated, the buzzer starts to sound.
